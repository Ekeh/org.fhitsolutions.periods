    This extension provides membership renewal periods/terms tracking. 
    Currently, when a membership is renewed in CiviCRM the “end date” field on the membership 
    itself is extended by the length of the membership as defined in CiviCRM membership type configuration 
    but no record of the actual length of any one period or term is recorded. As such it is not possible to 
    see how many “terms” or “periods” of membership a contact may have had.
